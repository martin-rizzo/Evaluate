QEVAL (Quick math expression evaluator)
=================================

Description
-----------

**QEVAL** is a cross-platform minimalist mathematical expression evaluator used as base of the QASM assembler, it is written in pure ANSI C using a simple quick-and-dirty approach.

The aim of this project is to implement a full-fledged integer expression evaluator in about 1000 lines of code. The project is only a prototype yet.


Usage
-----
To process and evaluate each line of a file use the following command:
    
    qeval [options] filename.txt
